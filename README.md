# Python-computer-vision

I'm in love with coding, especially cameras, AI and data. 
That's why for the last two years i'm learning about computer vision, machine learning/deep learning/AI. 
I know how to code in Python, C, C++.
I have used libraries: folium, numpy, pandas, justpy, pytz, matplotlib, bokeh, openpyxl, xlrd, opencv...
