# Python-computer-vision

I'm in love with cameras and coding. 
That's why for the last two years i'm learning about computer vision, machine learning/deep learning/AI. 
I know how to code in Python, C, C++.
I have used libraries: OpenCV, PCL, Open3D, Eigen, NumPy, Pandas, liberalsense(for RealSense cameras)
